Sharing our technical test below - here are the technologies you should use.

Tech stack:

- Next.js + TypeScript
- tRPC
- Prisma
- TailwindCSS
- PlanetScale
- Vercel (for deployment)
- OpenAI (for any AI required) (we will cover testing costs upto 5$ - make sure your prompt is as short as possible while delivering high quality results - feel free to use any model!)

You will need to implement the below Figma file and make it look as close to the Figma as possible - including all the spacings, paddings, margins, heights, font weight, etc. We're very specific about the final implementation looking the exact same as the Figma, so don't hesitate to spend time making sure everything is where it should be :)

I have also added comments on the Figma file. Once you complete the implementation, deploy it to Vercel and send over a link. There is no specific deadline for this, but the faster you can get this done, the better it is :)

If you have any questions, let me know and I'll be happy to answer :)

i have a few questions:
1. so i just have to create these modals right? or is there anything else that needs to be there in the app?
==> 1) only the modals. they should smoothly open on page load

2. the normal modal, and the AI modal: do i like create two buttons for it on the main page and the respective modal pops up whenever a button is clicked, or are both modals the same and i just have to start suggesting them AI results when they type in the deets?
==> 2) the latter - suggest AI results when they type in deets

3. a tiny doubt but is it okay if i just build out the modal on the screen or do i have to implement the button functionality and the modal popping up functionality? (this can be easily done but i'm still confirming)
==> 3) already confirmed in 1)

4. For the AI prompt, I'm thinking that I will need to provide it with the names of the projects (possibly their descriptions) and the types of tag that I have. So for now, do I just hard code random values for projects and tags? 
==> 4) yes, and yes you can hard-code tags & projects
